Dive bombed.

A game created in scratch for Harvard's CS50x course.

The aim of the game is to move the diver using the keyboards arrow keys.
Catch the starfish to earn a point.
If you touch the crab you lose a point.
You can enter in seconds the games duration.
The crab wil grow in size every 20 seconds.

Good luck!
